"""Integration tests for end-to-end semantic search through the graph.

Exercises the live embedding endpoint dimension, the Neo4j vector index, and
the graph expansion path. The graph contract stores only `embedding`, not the
source `embedding_text`, so self-ranking probes query with stored vectors.

Requires:
  - DBXCARTA_INCLUDE_EMBEDDINGS_TABLES=true in the most recent run — Table
    nodes must carry `embedding` vectors for the vector-index probes below.
  - A Databricks workspace reachable with the current SDK auth configuration.
