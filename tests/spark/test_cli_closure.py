"""The curated bootstrap closures must exclude DBR-provided packages.

The closures are installed by the runner bootstrap with ``--no-deps``
into the shared driver environment. Reinstalling a package the
Databricks Runtime already provides (the Spark runtime, or the
DBR-managed SDK and its auth subtree) would shadow the platform copy, so
the closures are hand-curated to omit them. This guards that policy as
the dependency pins change.
