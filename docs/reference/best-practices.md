# DBxCarta Best Practices

Design rules the pipeline follows, with sources. Organized by the two external systems it talks to (Spark/Databricks, Neo4j) and a short section of project-level principles that cut across both.

This is a living reference. When a rule is added or changed, cite the source.

## Spark / Databricks

### 1. Submit the full dataset to `ai_query` in one query

`ai_query` is built for batch inference. Databricks handles parallelization, retries, and scaling internally. Manually splitting the DataFrame into small batches reduces throughput rather than improving it.

**How we apply it:** the pipeline enriches the whole node DataFrame with a single `ai_query` column expression. No custom batching loop.

### 2. Use `failOnError => false` for production batches

With `failOnError => false`, a per-row failure returns a struct with `result = NULL` and a populated `errorMessage`. The query itself completes. The alternative aborts the entire job on the first bad input, which is not acceptable for a metadata-enrichment pipeline where one malformed row must not sink the run.

**How we apply it:** the transform projects `.result` as `embedding` and counts nulls against a configurable per-label and aggregate failure threshold. A returned vector whose length mismatches `DBXCARTA_EMBEDDING_DIMENSION` is normalized to null and counted as a row-level failure (no separate abort path).

### 3. Prefer batch-optimized Databricks-hosted embedding models

Databricks lists a specific set of batch-optimized models for production inference. Non-listed models still work but give lower throughput. For embeddings (1024-dim), the batch-optimized options are `databricks-gte-large-en` and `databricks-qwen3-embedding-0-6b`. `databricks-bge-large-en` is available but not on the batch-optimized list.

**How we apply it:** `DBXCARTA_EMBEDDING_ENDPOINT` defaults to `databricks-gte-large-en`. Swapping endpoints is a pure `.env` change because the dimension lives next to the endpoint.

Source: [Use `ai_query` — Supported models](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/large-language-models/ai-query#supported-models).

### 4. Materialize any DataFrame with `ai_query` before any second action reads it

Spark transformations are lazy. An `ai_query` column is just an expression until an action triggers evaluation. Every action against the same DataFrame evaluates the expression again, which means the endpoint is hit again, which means tokens are billed again. This is the single biggest latent cost trap in the pipeline.

Two downstream actions exist by default: the failure-rate aggregation, and the Neo4j Spark Connector write. If a ledger is added (Stage 7), that is a third.

**How we apply it:** the pipeline embeds and writes nodes in per-table-range batches. Each batch materializes its enriched node DataFrame to a short-lived per-(chunk, label) Delta table, reads that back for the failure-rate aggregation and the Neo4j write, then deletes the table immediately after that batch's Neo4j write. There is no single global staging table reused across the run; the embed-once guarantee holds per batch because the `ai_query` column is evaluated once into the transient table before any second action reads it. Delta is preferred over `.cache()` / `.persist()` because inference spend dwarfs I/O and because a materialized Delta table survives executor loss without re-inferencing.

Source: derived from Spark lazy-evaluation semantics and `ai_query` billing behavior (tokens charged per invocation). No single vendor doc states this in one place; see the Spark programming guide on [RDD persistence and lazy evaluation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html#rdd-persistence) as background.

### 5. Never collect catalog-scale data to the driver

Any path that collects rows whose count grows with catalog size — columns, constraints, embeddings, sampled values, or FK candidate pairs — scales driver memory with the catalog and becomes the run's ceiling well before the executors are saturated. At the ~10,000-table target this is hundreds of thousands of columns and an n²-shaped candidate space; a single all-pairs `collect()` or `spark.createDataFrame(rows)` on the driver cannot hold it. Catalog-scale work stays in DataFrames end to end (joins, windows, higher-order array functions); only fixed-size scalars (a `count()` for a run-summary stat) and statically-bounded sets cross to the driver.

**How we apply it — sampled values:** `_sample_values` in `transform/sample_values.py` returns a Spark DataFrame (or None when all queries fail) rather than rebuilding one from collected rows. `sample()` constructs `value_node_df` and `has_value_df` with Spark expressions: per-table DataFrames accumulated via `unionByName`, the per-column top-N applied with a `row_number()` window, the value ID as a `concat(..., md5(col))` expression, and `dropDuplicates(["id"])` as a defensive dedup. The only driver-bound results are two `.count()` scalars for run-summary stats.

**How we apply it — FK discovery (the largest such surface):** all of metadata and semantic FK inference runs in Spark via `fk/inference.py`, with no driver collect of columns, constraints, embeddings, or the value index:

- Columns are a per-column working frame from `build_columns_frame`, with the column-node `embedding` array left-joined and kept as a DataFrame column end to end (never collected, never normalized — see §7).
- Constraints are a Spark frame: `_constraints_df` in `fk/discovery.py` unions the per-catalog `information_schema` reads and feeds the frame straight into `build_pk_gate`; the PK-like gate and composite-PK count are Spark aggregations/joins, not a collected Python index.
- The value-overlap corroboration signal is a join on the Value/HAS_VALUE frames (`build_value_overlap`), not a collected value index.
- Metadata and semantic edges (`infer_metadata_edges`, `infer_semantic_edges`) are produced as DataFrames; prior-edge suppression is threaded as a `(source_id, target_id)` DataFrame anti-join (`_union_pairs`), never a collected set.

**Sanctioned exception — bounded declared-FK resolve:** `discover_declared` in `fk/declared.py` does `collect()` the resolved declared-FK pairs (and unresolved rows for logging). This is allowed because it is bounded by the number of *catalog-declared* foreign keys, not by the n²-shaped all-pairs space — it does not scale with column count and does not threaten driver memory at the 10,000-table target. The exception is specific to declared FKs; do not generalize it to the metadata or semantic paths, and do not "optimize" it away.

Source: derived from Spark lazy-evaluation semantics and the driver memory constraint for large catalogs.

### 6. Cache metadata DataFrames once, read them many times

`columns_df` is referenced by the sample-values transform (for candidate discovery) and by the column-node builder (for Neo4j writes) and would be read twice against `information_schema.columns` without caching. `information_schema` reads are cheap, but DAG stability and predictability are not.

**How we apply it:** `columns_df` is `.cache()`d in the extract stage. Sample-values candidate discovery is a pure in-memory filter over this cached DataFrame rather than a fresh UC read.

### 7. Express rule logic as native Spark; never as a Python UDF

Catalyst optimizes only what it can see. A Python UDF, including a vectorized `pandas_udf`, is opaque to the optimizer: it blocks predicate pushdown and whole-stage codegen, and it pays Arrow JVM-to-Python serialization on every batch. Across a large or n²-shaped join, that overhead dominates the query.

Most logic that looks like it needs a UDF is driven by small static tables: a suffix list, a type-class map, a score table, a stopword set. Those expand into native `Column` expressions and broadcast-join lookups at plan-construction time. The governing rule: Python builds the plan, Spark evaluates every row. A UDF is justified only when the per-row logic genuinely cannot be expressed with Catalyst expressions or higher-order array functions, and that bar is rarely met for metadata, string, or vector-math rules.

**How we apply it:** FK discovery is native DataFrame joins. Name-match stem and plural rules are generated as `Column` expressions by looping the static suffix list once while the plan is built. Type compatibility and the score table are broadcast-join lookups. Comment-token overlap uses `split`, `filter`, and `array_intersect`. Semantic cosine keeps persisted vectors unchanged and computes `dot / (norm(a) * norm(b))` with `aggregate` and `zip_with`. No `pandas_udf` anywhere in the FK path. The implementation is `fk/inference.py` (`infer_metadata_edges`, `infer_semantic_edges`, `build_pk_gate`, `canonicalize_expr`) orchestrated by `fk/discovery.py`.

Source: derived from Spark Catalyst optimization semantics; see the [Spark SQL performance tuning guide](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-performance-tuning.html) and the PySpark guidance that Python UDFs are a black box to the optimizer.

### 8. Release every cached DataFrame through a handle, including on failure paths

A cached or persisted DataFrame that survives the run leaks executor memory for the rest of the job. The risk is not the `.cache()` call itself but its lifecycle: a cache whose handle never escapes the function that created it cannot be released by the caller after the downstream actions finish, and a cache released only on the success path leaks whenever an exception unwinds past it. The rule: whatever caches a catalog-scale DataFrame must expose an unpersist handle, and the owner must release it in a `finally` so success and failure paths both release exactly once.

**How we apply it:**

- A stage that caches a DataFrame the caller needs across later actions returns the cache as an explicit handle on its result object, with an idempotent `unpersist_cached()` that no-ops when nothing was cached: `ExtractResult.unpersist_cached()` (`ingest/extract.py`), `ValueResult.cache_handle` / `unpersist_cached()` (`ingest/transform/value_stage.py`), and `FKDiscoveryResult.unpersist_cached()` for the inferred-edge caches (`ingest/fk/discovery.py`).
- The pipeline owner releases these in the `run.py` run-level `finally`, after `run_fk_discovery` and `_load` have finished reading them. Each release is independently guarded so one failure still attempts the others; on the success path a release failure is re-raised, on the failure path it is logged so it does not mask the original error.
- A cache whose lifecycle is internal to a single function is released by that function's own `finally`, not handed to the caller. `run_fk_discovery` persists `columns_frame` (`MEMORY_AND_DISK`, so eviction at the 10k-table target cannot cause a silent recompute of the n²-shaped lineage) and `pk_gate`, and unpersists both in a `finally` that also covers the failure path. This is deliberately separate from the caller-owned `FKDiscoveryResult` edge caches.

Source: derived from Spark cache lifecycle semantics and the executor-memory constraint for large catalogs; the `MEMORY_AND_DISK` choice over `cache()`/`MEMORY_ONLY` follows the same reasoning as §4 (a silent recompute re-runs expensive work, here the n²-shaped FK lineage rather than `ai_query` spend).

## Neo4j Spark Connector

### 1. `coalesce(1)` for relationships, `repartition(N, id)` for nodes

Neo4j write lock contention is the concern the connector docs warn about. Relationships lock both endpoint nodes, and any two Spark partitions writing relationships can contend on a shared endpoint node, so the connector's guidance to serialize writes applies straightforwardly. Nodes are different: uniqueness constraints lock per node id, so partitions that are disjoint on id cannot contend. `repartition(N, "id")` produces exactly that — hash-partitioning on a uniqueness-constrained property guarantees each node lands in a single partition, and parallel writes across partitions are safe by construction.

**How we apply it:**

- **Relationship writes** — every relationship DataFrame defaults to `.coalesce(1)` before the Neo4j write, because relationships always lock both endpoint nodes. The default is configurable via `DBXCARTA_REL_WRITE_PARTITIONS` (default `1`, which is exactly `coalesce(1)`); a value `> 1` repartitions for parallel writes and must only be raised with production evidence that Neo4j tolerates the added endpoint-lock contention. The single-partition default is the safe baseline and the correctness reasoning above holds for it.
- **Node writes** — every node DataFrame is `.repartition(N, "id")` before the Neo4j write, where `N` comes from `DBXCARTA_NEO4J_NODE_PARTITIONS` (default `4`). This is a standing rule, not a benchmark-gated optimization; no measurement is required to prove it's safe because the partitioning guarantees disjoint lock keys.

Tuning `N` is a throughput question, not a correctness question.

Source: [Neo4j Spark Connector — Parameter tuning, Write parallelism](https://neo4j.com/docs/spark/current/performance/tuning/#parallelism) (retrieved 2026-04-22). The "Dataset partitioning" subsection on that page sanctions the exception directly: "if your data writes are partitioned ahead of time to avoid locks, you can generally do as many write threads to Neo4j as there are cores in the server. Suppose we want to write a long list of `:Person` nodes, and we know they are distinct by the person `id`. We might stream those into Neo4j in four different partitions, as there will not be any lock contention." Our default `N=4` matches the example.

### 2. Tune `batch.size` above the default

The connector's default `batch.size` is deliberately conservative and is too low for most production workloads. The Neo4j docs suggest starting around 20,000 and raising it toward the server's heap capacity. Larger batches mean fewer transactions and lower per-write overhead; too-large batches hit heap limits and fail.

**How we apply it:** `DBXCARTA_NEO4J_BATCH_SIZE` defaults to `20000`. The setting is exposed in `.env` so it can be tuned without a code change as catalog size and node property sizes grow.

### 3. Remember that Aura writes are leader-only and scale vertically

On AuraDB and any causal cluster, only the leader accepts writes. Write throughput scales with the cores on the leader, not with the number of Spark executors. This bounds the point at which adding more Spark parallelism stops helping.

**How we apply it:** the pipeline treats Spark-side parallelism as a second-order tuning knob, not a first-order solution. Node writes use a modest default (`DBXCARTA_NEO4J_NODE_PARTITIONS=4`, see §1); raise it incrementally against measured throughput once write volume justifies it.

Source: [Neo4j Spark Connector — Parameter tuning, Write parallelism](https://neo4j.com/docs/spark/current/performance/tuning/#parallelism) (retrieved 2026-04-21).

### 4. Create vector indexes before writing embedded nodes

Vector indexes populate asynchronously for existing data, but creating the index first lets the connector populate it as rows land rather than requiring a separate reindex pass. Dimension and similarity function are fixed at index creation and cannot be altered without dropping the index.

**How we apply it:** the bootstrap step at the top of the LOAD stage reads `DBXCARTA_EMBEDDING_DIMENSION` and creates a cosine-similarity vector index per enabled label before any node write.

Source: [Neo4j vector index](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/indexes/semantic-indexes/vector-indexes/) (retrieved 2026-04-21).

### 5. Fail closed at the node write boundary: project to the per-label property allowlist

The connector writes every column present in the DataFrame as a node property. Helper, intermediate, and embedding-bookkeeping columns ride the node DataFrame through the transform stages; if they reach the write unfiltered they leak into the graph as silent extra properties (the defect that motivated this rule was `table_schema` ending up on every node). A denylist is fail-open — any new helper column added upstream silently becomes a property until someone notices. The boundary is therefore an allowlist that fails closed: the write projects to exactly the declared per-label property set and raises if a required property is absent, rather than writing whatever happens to be present.

**How we apply it:** `contract.py` defines `NODE_PROPERTIES`, the per-label property allowlist; a column is a graph property if and only if it is listed there. `_project` in `run.py` raises `RuntimeError` when a declared property (other than the legitimately optional `embedding`) is missing from the DataFrame, then selects exactly the allowlisted columns before every `write_node` call in `_load`. Embedding bookkeeping (`embedding_text`, `embedding_text_hash`, `embedding_model`, `embedded_at`) lives in Delta staging and the ledger and is dropped at this boundary by construction, never written as a node property. Structural membership is expressed as edges, not duplicated as scalar node properties.

Source: derived from the Neo4j Spark Connector writing every DataFrame column as a node property, plus the project's graph-contract correctness requirement.

## Project-level principles

These are not vendor best practices; they are consequences of the two vendor rules above plus the project's correctness requirements.

### 1. Unity Catalog is the only source of truth

The pipeline reads UC, writes Neo4j, and does not read Neo4j at any point during a run. This keeps the sink decoupled from pipeline state, makes partial-graph recovery a non-issue (reruns are idempotent MERGEs), and makes candidate discovery a pure function of UC.

### 2. Pipeline-owned artifacts memo, they do not authorize

Any caching layer introduced for cost reasons (e.g. the Stage 7 Delta embedding ledger) is a memo of "what we've already spent tokens on," never authority. Dropping the ledger must produce a correct run on the next invocation; at worst, one run re-embeds everything.

### 3. Fail fast on missing permissions; never degrade silently

The preflight enumerates every grant and endpoint permission the enabled flags require, and aborts before any read or write if any are missing. There is no partial-graph mode.

### 4. Embedding failures are counted, not thrown

`ai_query` with `failOnError => false` returns nulls rather than exceptions. The pipeline counts attempts and successes per label, computes a failure rate both per-label and in aggregate, and fails the run only if either exceeds the configured threshold. This catches the case where one label silently degrades while another masks it in aggregate.

### 5. Verify the cluster runs the current source before interpreting run output

`submit` is a reference operation, not a build operation. The runner attaches the wheel last uploaded to the UC Volume and executes the script last uploaded to the Databricks workspace; it does not rebuild or re-upload either on `submit`. Running stale code against real infrastructure produces misleading signal — apparent failures may be old bugs already fixed, apparent successes may hide regressions in new code, and the run summary reflects whatever the cluster actually ran, not what the local source says.

Any time source files change, run `dbxcarta upload --wheel && dbxcarta upload --all` before `dbxcarta submit`. Treat `job_name` and `contract_version` in the JSON run summary as a quick sanity check that the expected code ran; a wrong prefix (e.g. `schema_graph_*` instead of `dbxcarta_*`) means the workspace script is stale and a re-upload is required before interpreting any results.

### 6. Make Databricks targets explicit at the configuration boundary

Pipeline-owned artifacts are Unity Catalog objects, so their configuration should name the exact UC target instead of relying on workspace defaults. `DBXCARTA_SUMMARY_TABLE` is required to be `catalog.schema.table`, and writable file locations must be `/Volumes/<catalog>/<schema>/<volume>/<subdir>`, not DBFS paths or bare volume roots.

All dynamic identifiers are validated before use and then backtick-quoted at SQL construction. Serving endpoint names are validated before interpolation into `ai_query` calls. Local tooling builds `WorkspaceClient` from `DATABRICKS_PROFILE` when present, otherwise it lets the Databricks SDK use its default authentication chain.

### 7. The node ID is the authoritative catalog/schema/table identity

Every node ID is catalog-qualified by construction, so the ID alone fully determines which catalog, schema, and table a retrieved node belongs to. The graph spans multiple catalogs (bronze, silver, and gold across the resolved catalogs), so any consumer that rebuilds a fully-qualified name by substituting a single configured catalog (e.g. `settings.dbxcarta_catalog`) produces a wrong FQN for every node outside that one catalog. Catalog/schema/table identity is recovered from the node, never from configuration.

**How we apply it:** `dbxcarta-client` reconstructs the FQN from the authoritative per-node identity. `graph_retriever.py` walks `Database → Schema → Table` and builds the FQN from each node's own `name` property; `ids.py` (`catalog_from_node_id` / `schema_from_node_id`) parses the catalog-qualified node ID rather than assuming a single configured catalog. `settings.dbxcarta_catalog` is used only as the seed anchor in eval-harness paths, never as the catalog of a retrieved node.

Source: derived from the catalog-qualified node-ID scheme and the multi-catalog graph requirement.

### 8. Inferred FK edges require type and target-key evidence; declared FKs are authoritative

A name match is a candidate, not a foreign key. Every inferred edge (metadata and semantic) must additionally clear two hard gates: the source and target types must be compatible, and the target must carry primary-key or unique evidence. A name match with neither is never emitted. Declared catalog foreign keys are authoritative: an inferred edge that duplicates one a higher-authority strategy already emitted is suppressed, not re-emitted at a different confidence. Accuracy tuning may tighten these gates but may not weaken them.

**How we apply it:** in `fk/inference.py`, both `infer_metadata_edges` and `infer_semantic_edges` apply the `canonicalize_expr` type-equality predicate and an inner join against `build_pk_gate`'s PK-evidence frame as hard filters — no edge survives either one failing. Authority order is threaded in `fk/discovery.py`: metadata left-anti-joins declared-only edges, semantic left-anti-joins `declared ∪ metadata` (`_union_pairs`), so declared suppresses inferred and metadata suppresses semantic.

Source: derived from FK correctness requirements (a name match alone is not a foreign key) and the declared-edge authority ordering.
