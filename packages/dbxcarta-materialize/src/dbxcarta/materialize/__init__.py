"""dbxcarta materialize: the Spark job that turns a blueprint into Delta tables.

The pure statement builders live in :mod:`dbxcarta.materialize.builders`; the
rest of this package is the imperative shell that owns the ``SparkSession``, asks
the builders for the statements, runs them with ``spark.sql``, overlaps the
independent table creates in a bounded thread pool, runs the foreign-key pass
serially after, and writes a run-summary record. Import the entrypoint lazily
through the console script so a plain import of this package does not pull in
PySpark.
