"""DBxCarta ingestion orchestrator.

Thin coordinator for the ingest run. Its job is limited to:
  1. Construct Settings (fails loudly at boundary via cross-field validators).
  2. Run preflight (fails before any destructive action).
  3. Call extract → transform (embed, sample) → FK discovery → load.
  4. Emit the RunSummary.

The module intentionally keeps domain work in focused ingest modules under
`fk`, `transform`, and `load`. Pipeline functions here wire those modules
together and update run-level counters so the Databricks task has one clear
entry point.
