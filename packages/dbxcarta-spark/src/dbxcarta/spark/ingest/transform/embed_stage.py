"""Embedding transform stage.

Owns one primitive: embed a single batch's node frame *once* and freeze it
to a transient Delta materialization, so the per-batch failure-count check
and the Neo4j node write both read the same result and ai_query is invoked
exactly once. There is no whole-catalog staging table and no failure-rate
gate: the run orchestrator drives node embedding + the Neo4j write in
batches by table range, and `embedded_batch` enforces a configurable
per-batch failure *count* before the batch is allowed to be written.

The per-label embedding-text expressions are not here: each node builder
attaches a single `embedding_text` column from the one source of truth
(contract.EMBEDDING_TEXT_EXPR), and this stage simply hashes and embeds it.

    `df` carries a builder-attached `embedding_text` column; the hash and the
    ai_query input both derive from it, so the ledger never churns from a
    hash/embed mismatch. When DBXCARTA_LEDGER_ENABLED, rows whose
    embedding_text_hash and model already exist in the per-label ledger are
    served from the ledger (no ai_query call); only misses call the endpoint
    and the ledger is then upserted with the new vectors (excluding errors).
    The ledger is keyed by text-hash + model, so a per-batch call already
    scopes the read and the upsert — there is no global ledger read.

    The embedded frame is written to a transient Delta path and read back so
    the caller's Neo4j write and the failure-count check both consume one
    ai_query pass. Per-batch attempts/successes/ledger-hits accumulate into
    `summary`; if this batch's failure count exceeds
    DBXCARTA_EMBEDDING_FAILURE_MAX the run fails *before* the batch is
    yielded (so nothing is written). The transient path is always deleted on
