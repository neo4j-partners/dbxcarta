"""UC Volume path resolution and transient per-batch Delta materialization.

Everything in this module is pure path arithmetic or Delta/dbutils I/O —
no Neo4j driver state and no Unity Catalog metadata query. There is no
whole-catalog staging table: each (batch, label) embedding result is written
to a short-lived transient Delta path purely to invoke ai_query once (the
failure-count check and the Neo4j write both read it back), then deleted as
soon as that batch is written. The ledger root is the durable cross-run cache
and is never truncated.
