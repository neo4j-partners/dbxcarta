"""Shared UC Volume I/O helpers used across the stages.

The summary emitters (ingest, client, materialize) all write a JSON file under a
UC Volume FUSE path, and the host-side tools (question upload, materialize
blueprint staging) all push a local file to a Volume through the Files API. Both
patterns were copy-pasted per stage; this module is their single home so the
managed-prefix depth rule and the upload contract live in one place.

Core stays SDK-light: the ``WorkspaceClient`` type is only referenced under
``TYPE_CHECKING`` and the SDK error is imported inside the function that needs
it, so importing this module pulls in neither the SDK nor PySpark.
