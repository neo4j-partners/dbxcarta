"""The catalog-list policy rule shared across the dbxcarta query and operator layers.

``resolve_catalogs`` is the single source of truth for "which catalogs does
this run touch". ``ClientSettings`` and the operator readiness check resolve
their catalog set through it, so every dbxcarta-side consumer agrees on the
``catalog:layer`` list form. The neocarta ingest connector owns the equivalent
rule on its side.

    The single source of truth for "which catalogs does this run touch".
    Both the readiness check and the pipeline resolve their catalog set
    through this one function, so they can never disagree.

    Each entry in ``catalogs`` is ``catalog`` or ``catalog:layer``; the
    ``:layer`` suffix is stripped here. A blank list falls back to the single
    ``catalog``, preserving the historical single-catalog behavior. Duplicates
    are collapsed: a repeated catalog would otherwise double-count extract
    totals and re-write every node. Every resolved name is validated with the
    same rule the pipeline uses, so a malformed catalog fails loud wherever the
    list is resolved.
