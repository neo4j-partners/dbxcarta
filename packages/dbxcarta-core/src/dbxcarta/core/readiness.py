"""Readiness check and question upload for dbxcarta integrations.

Both operations are driven entirely by the per-example
``examples/<name>/dbxcarta-overlay.env`` the CLI has already loaded plus the
example's bundled ``questions.json``; there is no per-example Python object to
publish. :func:`check_readiness` reads the catalog list from the environment,
and :func:`upload_questions` reads the destination from the environment and
takes the questions file as an argument. The CLI (``dbxcarta ready`` /
``dbxcarta upload-questions``) calls these directly.
